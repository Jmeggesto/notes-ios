Notes
=====

Overview
--------

Notes is a (very) pared-down clone of Apple's Notes app built using Core Data as a demo for Access Code 2.2. It currently includes two screens:

1. A list view that gives a quick preview of each note, as well as provides UI for creating and deleting notes
2. A detail view that allows editing
